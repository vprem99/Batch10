What is Java ?
---------------------
-It is High level Programming Language
-Free & Open Source
-WORA(Write Once & Run Aywhere) - It is platform independant
-It is Easy to learn (All keywords are very similar to English Language)
-Secure
-Supports Multi-Threading (Multiple Functions can be run simultanously/parallely)


Configurations Needs:
-----------------------------
1.JDK
		It makes your system aware about what is java, protocols of Java etc.
2.Editor i.e Notepad, Notepad++, Eclipse, Netbean
		
How to check system is having Java or Not ?
		java -version


JDK > When you want to Dev + Run 
JRE > When you want to Just Run already Develop Application


Java's Programme Execution Sequence:
--------------------------------------------------

A.java			>  Compiler > A.class (Bytecode-intermediate language) ->   JVM(Interpreter)
				> converts into 0 & 1

There is two execution in Java due to which java is platform indepenadant.


1.Create Project
2.Create Package
3.Create Class


Data Type:
--------------
int 
boolean
char
byte
float
double
short
int
long

Arithmatic Operator:
--------------------------
+
-
/
*
%


Comparision Operator:
>
<
>=
<=
==
!=


Logical Operators:
&&  - AND
||	    OR
! 	    NOT


String name;
Human prem





Loops: Needs> If you want to do something multiple time then use loop concept
-----
1.For Loop
2.while
3.Do_While
4.For Each (Array, Collection( List, Set))



1.for
			fibonacci Series:
			---------------------
			a   b  c
			0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
			    a   b c




While
-COndition  Check & then Do
-Code may or may not execute depending on condition ( No garantee of Execution of  code for once)


do_while
-First Do & Check
-Code gives garantee of execution at least for once

int num =1234
		num/10= 123
		num%10= 4


		123/10= 12
		123%10= 3		
				

		rem*10+rem
		4*10+3 =43

		12/10= 1
		12%10=2

		1/10= 0
		1%10= 1

Java OOPs


Object:  Any real time entity which is having States & Beahvior


States/Properties (These will be noun) 			>>> Variables
		-BrandName
		-Type
		-Price
		-Color
		-Dimension



Beahvior/Actions : (These are Verbs) 			>> Methods
		-Writing
		-Opening/Closing
		-Changing Refill



Class : Combination of relevent states & Behavior
	   BluePrint of Object






Static KeyWord: It is keyword which can be used with variables & Methods
---------------------

Adv:
------
1.It is used for memory managment
2.It is also used for Quick access to some methods/variable as per requirements




Inheritance: Getting property of  Parent Class to its Child Class
--------------

Loan Management System:
---------------------------------
Class Loan{
200 loc
}

Class HomeLoan extends Loan				Class EducationLoan extends Loan				Class GoldLoan extends Loan
{										{											{
300 loc 									300 loc										300 loc
}										}											}


PersonalLoan extends Loan
{
300 loc
}

Total LOC : 2000
Time: 24 hrs



Total LOC: 1400
time : 18 hrs


Adv: 
1.LOC will be Less
2.Devloping time will be less
3.If LOC is less application will be faster
4.Application will be Easy to Change/ Maintain
