What is Java ?
---------------------
-It is High level Programming Language
-Free & Open Source
-WORA(Write Once & Run Aywhere) - It is platform independant
-It is Easy to learn (All keywords are very similar to English Language)
-Secure
-Supports Multi-Threading (Multiple Functions can be run simultanously/parallely)


Configurations Needs:
-----------------------------
1.JDK
		It makes your system aware about what is java, protocols of Java etc.
2.Editor i.e Notepad, Notepad++, Eclipse, Netbean
		
How to check system is having Java or Not ?
		java -version


JDK > When you want to Dev + Run 
JRE > When you want to Just Run already Develop Application


Java's Programme Execution Sequence:
--------------------------------------------------

A.java			>  Compiler > A.class (Bytecode-intermediate language) ->   JVM(Interpreter)
				> converts into 0 & 1

There is two execution in Java due to which java is platform indepenadant.


1.Create Project
2.Create Package
3.Create Class


Data Type:
--------------
int 
boolean
char
byte
float
double
short
int
long

Arithmatic Operator:
--------------------------
+
-
/
*
%


Comparision Operator:
>
<
>=
<=
==
!=


Logical Operators:
&&  - AND
||	    OR
! 	    NOT


String name;
Human prem





Loops: Needs> If you want to do something multiple time then use loop concept
-----
1.For Loop
2.while
3.Do_While
4.For Each (Array, Collection( List, Set))



1.for
			fibonacci Series:
			---------------------
			a   b  c
			0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
			    a   b c




While
-COndition  Check & then Do
-Code may or may not execute depending on condition ( No garantee of Execution of  code for once)


do_while
-First Do & Check
-Code gives garantee of execution at least for once

int num =1234
		num/10= 123
		num%10= 4


		123/10= 12
		123%10= 3		
				

		rem*10+rem
		4*10+3 =43

		12/10= 1
		12%10=2

		1/10= 0
		1%10= 1
		
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java OOPs


Object:  Any real time entity which is having States & Beahvior


States/Properties (These will be noun) 			>>> Variables
		-BrandName
		-Type
		-Price
		-Color
		-Dimension



Beahvior/Actions : (These are Verbs) 			>> Methods
		-Writing
		-Opening/Closing
		-Changing Refill



Class : Combination of relevent states & Behavior
	   BluePrint of Object






Static KeyWord: It is keyword which can be used with variables & Methods
---------------------

Adv:
------
1.It is used for memory managment
2.It is also used for Quick access to some methods/variable as per requirements




Inheritance: Getting property of  Parent Class to its Child Class
--------------

Loan Management System:
---------------------------------
Class Loan{
200 loc
}

Class HomeLoan extends Loan				Class EducationLoan extends Loan				Class GoldLoan extends Loan
{										{											{
300 loc 									300 loc										300 loc
}										}											}


PersonalLoan extends Loan
{
300 loc
}

Total LOC : 2000
Time: 24 hrs



Total LOC: 1400
time : 18 hrs


Adv: 
1.LOC will be Less
2.Devloping time will be less
3.If LOC is less application will be faster
4.Application will be Easy to Change/ Maintain


								


Every Car IS-A Vehicle
Every Bike IS-A Vehicle
Every Truck IS-A Vehcile

Vehicle{

}


Polymorphism:
-------------------
Many forms

There will multiple methods with same name but different implementation




1.Method Overriding
		> There is need of two classes for this with parent & Child Relationship
	  	> There is need of same method in parent also & in Child also but with different 				   implementation  for overriding code of Parent.


		
2.Method Overloading
			> There is no need of Two Classes, Single Class is sufficient for this
			> There are multiple methods in single class with same name but different 							implementation/arguments/data type. 
		


Constructor:
1.It is having same name as ClassName
2.It do not have return type



Benefits: If you want to execute some set of code while making object of that class then you 			    can use constructor i.e initialization of class level variables/instance variable with 			    custom values.
	



Basic Encapsulation:
Keeping relevent methods & variable into single unit will be called as Encapsulation

But Security can be increased by using different access modifiers like public, private, protected etc.

Encapsulation is also defined as Hidding Data for increasing security .


private : Variable/ Method will not be visible outside of that class


public: Visible EveryWhere
private: Visible inside class Only
protected/default: Visible within package only
protected : It will give its protected mathod/ variable to its child even if it is outside package

Encapsulation: It is hindding Data
Abstraction: Showing necessary things after Hidding un-necessary things.


Interface:
------------

Samsung 


Interface is a set of Protocol/Rule

Galaxy					Eseries				Jseries						Note
D1							D2						D3							D4

inCll						in_Call				incomingCall				incomingCalling



21 > Abstract Class,Exception Handling, & Collection.


Exception Handling:
--------------------------

It is used for handling abnormal termination of your programme. & Only Risky part is written inside in Exception handling part.
By Keeping rissky part in try block rest LOC will be executed.


		try{
		// Keep your risky code here
		}catch(ArithmaticException A){
		.....
		}
		.
		.
		.
		catch(Exception A){

		}


Kinds of Exception
1.Checked : High Chance of Occurance  | Compile Time

		i.e FileNotFoundException

2.UnChecked:		Less Chance of Occurance   | Run Time

		i.e ArithMaticException






ExceptionHandlingExample.java   > compiler > ExceptionHandlingExample.class   > JVM(Interpreter)  > 01's 


int []mobile=new int[20];




Environment Needs for Selenium WebDriver:
1.JDK
2.Eclipse
3.Selenium Java Libraries for Scripting in Java
4.Drivers i.e chromedriver.exe for working with chrome browser
		     geckodriver.exe for working with Firefox 
		     operadriver.exe for opera browser



There can be two types project 
1.Java Project
2.Maven Project

The path to the driver executable must be set by the webdriver.chrome.driver system property;


Selenium Locators: Locators are unique property by which selenium finds that object/element/WebElement 
------------------------
1.id
2.name
3.linkText
4.css
5.Xpath
